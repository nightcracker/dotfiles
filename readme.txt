Orson Peters' dotfiles
======================
This is my personalized dotfiles repository. You can look around, but unless
you are me using the dotfiles as-is is probably not recommended.

Installation instructions are in install.txt.

How to maintain the project and update software used within it is documented in
maintaining.txt.
